# React and Personal
This project is to setup my portfolio website using react. 

## Goals
* Modern with hover and click interactability. 
* Scalable and Reusable without losing flavor
* StraightForward and connects projects for easy View.

### Includes
1. React-app
2. Redux and Redux Toolkit
3. React-Router
4. Font-Awesome core and Public Icons
5. More Items to come as project grows and evolves

#### Future Products
I figured I had to make a new portfolio site, I might as well show off the snippets, and the product. 
I have more projects in **Mind** as I continue my *Full Stack Learning* Journey such as:

* Wedding/Event RSVP
* Grocery List with Estimate Price and Savings
* Fivem content for servers such as a 90's style drug empire script
